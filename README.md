I have developed the first working version (V1) of the TravelMate UK project the frontend. I would be very thankful for your feedback - especially regarding any specialty or improvement you think I should add or change to this level. 

Also, I would like to ask you about some technical details:

 At present, I am loading restaurant and hotel data from local JSON files in data folder and I am using map() to display them. Do you think I should now move this part to use an API that receives data from an actual database? Given the fact that the project is based on a MERN stack structure, I think it may be better to use mongodb rather than postgresql in this case, do you agree? 

I was also wondering how to make the site more useful and realistic? The booking facility at present is very basic and is mostly for testing. Do you think it makes more sense to concentrate more on the site as a travel guide - some useful and good structured information without provision of real bookings? I want the project to be practical, not just "play with a database", so your advice here will be very useful.
